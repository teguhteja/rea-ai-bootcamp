API with FastAPI
================

Picture this - You‚Äôve spent endless hours meticulously gathering data, performing feature engineering, tuning hyperparameters, and training a machine learning model. This model has surpassed your expectations, delivering excellent results and insightful predictions. You‚Äôre thrilled, filled with a sense of achievement, and now you‚Äôre eager to share this AI marvel with the world. But there‚Äôs a catch - how do you make this trained model accessible to others? How do you turn this static, local file into a dynamic and interactive service?

This is where **API**s _(Application Programming Interfaces)_ and **FastAPI** come to the rescue!

APIs: The Heroes of Connectivity
--------------------------------

An **API** is essentially a set of rules that specify how different software applications should interact and communicate. APIs discreetly expose the functions of an application in a secure way, making them available for other applications to utilize. They are like diplomats, fostering relations and enabling seamless data transfer between different software systems.

‚Äúapi-flow‚Äù

FastAPI: The Speedy Python-to-Web Translator
--------------------------------------------

Now, let‚Äôs talk about [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. This handy tool is your go-to solution for setting up a simple yet powerful API. It enables you to map Python functions to specific URLs, transforming these operations into network-accessible services.

On Your Marks, Get Set, FastAPI!

Excited? Let‚Äôs dive right into crafting APIs with FastAPI! Before we set sail, ensure FastAPI is installed. You can do this using pip:

    %pip install fastapi uvicorn pyngrok

### Igniting the FastAPI

Let‚Äôs kick-start our FastAPI adventure by initiating a basic application:

    %%writefile main.py
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"Welcome": "Welcome to our API!"}

    Overwriting main.py

The cell above will create a `main.py` file _(or overwrite it if it already exists)_ according to the code in that cell but using the magic command `%%writefile main.py`

Now we can run `main.py` using [**Uvicorn**](https://www.uvicorn.org/). What is Uvicorn? ü§î This is a very fast ASGI server implementation, used to serve your FastAPI applications. ASGI, short for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, is a standard interface between web servers, frameworks, and async-enabled Python applications. Uvicorn serves as a bridge between your FastAPI applications and the outside world.

Use the command below in your **terminal** to run the application

    uvicorn main:app --reload

> **Note**: make sure the directory position of your terminal is the same as the `main.py` file

‚Äúfast-api-running‚Äù

Congratulations! You have just kindled the first sparks of your FastAPI application. With just a few lines of code, you‚Äôve transformed a simple python function into a full-fledged API service.

But how do we know if it‚Äôs working? ü§î You can try with `curl`:

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/langchain/curl-get.png)

‚Äúcurl-get‚Äù

What if we want to run it in the Jupyter Notebook cell? ü§î Let‚Äôs send a request to our new application and see what happens.

    import uvicorn
    import nest_asyncio
    
    nest_asyncio.apply()
    
    # Start server synchronous
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

We‚Äôve started our FastAPI application, and are now waiting for incoming requests.

We can use curl again to try it out:

‚Äúcurl-get‚Äù

So far, so good. Our API is up, running and has successfully responded to our request. But let‚Äôs consider a scenario. What if you want to share your newly built API with your colleagues or deploy it for a demo. Running the API on localhost won‚Äôt be visible to others on the internet.

This is where [**Ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/) comes into play. Ngrok is a fantastic tool that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to your localhost. But before we can utilize it, we need a token. Let‚Äôs see how we can get this token:

1.  **Visit the Ngrok website.** The first step is to visit [Ngrok‚Äôs official website](https://ngrok.com/).
2.  **Create an account.** Once you‚Äôre on the website, you need to create an account. If you already have one, you can simply log in.
3.  **Verify your account.** After signing up, you will receive a verification email. Click on the link in that email to verify your account.
4.  **Log in to your account.** Once your account is verified, log in to your Ngrok account.
5.  **Get your token.** After logging in, you will be directed to the dashboard. Here, you can find your Auth token under the ‚ÄòAuth‚Äô section.

Let‚Äôs illustrate the final step with an image:

‚ÄúNgrok Auth Token‚Äù

Remember to keep your token secure, as anyone with access to it can create a tunnel to your localhost.

Enter the token you have obtained

    your_ngrok_token = "" # @param {type:"string"} 

With the ngrok token in our hands, we are now ready to expose our local API to the world. Let‚Äôs set it up and give it a shot!

Try api using `pyngrok`

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

Now we‚Äôre ready to share our API with the world! We‚Äôve set up a secure tunnel using ngrok, and our API is now accessible from anywhere. You can easily share the public URL with others, and they can interact with your API in real-time.

Access the api endpoint via `ngrok` (click Visit Site)

‚Äúngrok-warning-free‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a piece of advice! While ngrok is a fantastic tool, remember that the free version of ngrok includes certain limitations. It provides a random URL every time you start a new session, and the connections can occasionally be slow. For extensive use, consider opting for a paid plan.

Look at that! You‚Äôve just given birth to your first API using FastAPI and made it accessible to the world through ngrok. This API now functions with a single endpoint at the root URL (‚Äò/‚Äô) which offers a friendly welcome message. Isn‚Äôt it thrilling to witness your Python functions communicating with the world? This is just the beginning of your FastAPI journey. As you dive deeper, you‚Äôll uncover its power to build more complex and powerful APIs. Happy exploring!

But before we wrap up, don‚Äôt forget to **kill the server process** when done!

To do so, you need to find the process ID (PID) and kill it - the method varies depending on the operating system.

*   **On Windows**, you can use `netstat -ano | findstr :<YourPort>` to find the PID and `taskkill /PID <PID> /F` to kill the process.
*   **On Linux/Mac**, `lsof -i :<YourPort>` and `kill -9 <PID>` should do the trick.

### API Endpoints & HTTP Methods: A Deeper Dive!

Imagine you‚Äôre building an online store. You need to provide your users with a way to view products, add items to their shopping cart, and make purchases. This is where FastAPI‚Äôs ability to create multiple API endpoints and utilize different HTTP methods comes into play.

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/products")
    def get_products():
        return {"message": "Display all products"}
    
    @app.post("/cart/{item_id}")
    def add_to_cart(item_id: int):
        return {"message": f"Added item with id {item_id} to the cart"}
    
    @app.delete("/cart/{item_id}")
    def remove_from_cart(item_id: int):
        return {"message": f"Removed item with id {item_id} from the cart"}

    Overwriting main.py

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

Now to carry out tests, in Fast API there is an **Interactive API docs** feature where we can see detailed information about the API that we created and make test requests directly there.

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) or [https://{ngrok-url}/docs](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/docs)

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)):

OK now, we will revise the previous code and add **in-memory data structures** for `products` and `cart` to make it more interactive:

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Our product list - a dictionary where key is product id and value is product name
    products = {1: "Sneakers", 2: "T-Shirt", 3: "Jeans", 4: "Sunglasses", 5: "Hat"}
    
    # The shopping cart - a dictionary where key is product id and value is quantity
    cart = {}
    
    @app.get("/products")
    def get_products():
        return products
    
    @app.post("/cart/{product_id}")
    def add_to_cart(product_id: int):
        if product_id not in products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
        if product_id in cart:
            cart[product_id] += 1
        else:
            cart[product_id] = 1
        return {"message": f"Added {products[product_id]} to the cart"}
    
    @app.delete("/cart/{product_id}")
    def remove_from_cart(product_id: int):
        if product_id not in cart:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not in cart")
        cart[product_id] -= 1
        if cart[product_id] == 0:
            del cart[product_id]
        return {"message": f"Removed {products[product_id]} from the cart"}
    
    @app.get("/cart")
    def get_cart():
        return {products[product_id]: quantity for product_id, quantity in cart.items()}

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

Now, our API server can handle the following requests: - `GET` requests to `/products` to view all products. - `POST` requests to `/cart/{product_id}` to add products to the cart. - `DELETE` requests to `/cart/{product_id}` to remove products from the cart. - `GET` requests to `/cart` to view the cart contents.

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs), [https://{ngrok-url}/docs](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/docs) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) or [https://{ngrok-url}/redoc](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/redoc) for interactive documentation your API

### Working with JSON Responses and Requests

All the data exchanged between the client and server in our online store scenario happens in the form of JSON. FastAPI makes it ultra-easy to handle JSON data.

Let‚Äôs say, instead of adding one product at a time to the cart, we want to allow customers to add multiple products at once. They can send a list of product IDs as JSON data in a POST request, and FastAPI will automatically convert it to a Python list for us.

    %%writefile main.py
    from typing import List
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Our product list - a dictionary where key is product id and value is product name
    products = {1: "Sneakers", 2: "T-Shirt", 3: "Jeans", 4: "Sunglasses", 5: "Hat"}
    
    # The shopping cart - a dictionary where key is product id and value is quantity
    cart = {}
    
    @app.post("/cart/items")
    async def add_items_to_cart(item_ids: List[int]):
        not_found_ids = [item_id for item_id in item_ids if item_id not in products]
        if not_found_ids:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Products with ids {not_found_ids} were not found.")
        
        for item_id in item_ids:
            if item_id in cart:
                cart[item_id] += 1
            else:
                cart[item_id] = 1
        response = {products[item_id]: quantity for item_id, quantity in cart.items()}
        return response

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

Customers can now perform the following actions: - Add multiple items to the cart in one go by: - Sending a `POST` request to `/cart/items` with a JSON array of product ids. - FastAPI will automatically parse the JSON data into a Python list. - Corresponding products will be added to the cart. - If a product is not found in our store: - The system will raise an `HTTPException` with a 404 status code.

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs), [https://{ngrok-url}/docs](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/docs) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) or [https://{ngrok-url}/redoc](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/redoc) for interactive documentation your API

### Handling Errors Gracefully

In an ideal world, users would always use our online store API perfectly. They‚Äôd only add products that exist, they wouldn‚Äôt attempt to remove products from an empty cart, and they certainly wouldn‚Äôt try to buy more products than we have in stock.

But we don‚Äôt live in an ideal world.

Thankfully, FastAPI provides an easy way to handle errors and raise HTTP exceptions with meaningful error messages.

    %%writefile main.py
    from typing import List
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Our product list - a dictionary where key is product id and value is product name
    products = {1: "Sneakers", 2: "T-Shirt", 3: "Jeans", 4: "Sunglasses", 5: "Hat"}
    
    # The shopping cart - a dictionary where key is product id and value is quantity
    cart = {}
    
    @app.get("/products/{product_id}")
    async def get_product(product_id: int):
        if product_id not in products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"No product found with id {product_id}.")
        return {product_id: products[product_id]}
    
    @app.post("/cart/items")
    async def add_items_to_cart(item_ids: List[int]):
        not_found_ids = [item_id for item_id in item_ids if item_id not in products]
        if not_found_ids:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Products with ids {not_found_ids} were not found.")
        
        for item_id in item_ids:
            if item_id in cart:
                cart[item_id] += 1
            else:
                cart[item_id] = 1
        response = {products[item_id]: quantity for item_id, quantity in cart.items()}
        return response
    
    @app.delete("/cart/{product_id}")
    async def remove_from_cart(product_id: int):
        if product_id not in cart:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not in cart.")
        cart[product_id] -= 1
        if cart[product_id] == 0:
            del cart[product_id]
        return {"message": f"Removed {products[product_id]} from the cart"}

    Overwriting main.py

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

In this script, we‚Äôve enhanced our API endpoints to handle common error cases such as: - If a user tries to view a product that doesn‚Äôt exist. - If a user tries to add a non-existent product to their cart. - If a user tries to remove a product from an empty cart.

In these instances, FastAPI will: - Raise an `HTTPException` with a 404 status code. - Provide a descriptive error message.

We have performed tests on these enhancements: - Made a `GET` request to the `/products/{product_id}` endpoint with a non-existent product id. - As expected, our API returned a 404 status code with an appropriate error message.

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs), [https://{ngrok-url}/docs](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/docs) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) or [https://{ngrok-url}/redoc](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/redoc) for interactive documentation your API

### Rendering HTML

FastAPI is not limited to exchange JSON data. It can also handle and render HTML. This is useful if, besides the API, you want to have an introductory web page for your online store. All we need to do is return a multiline string (enclosed in triple quotes) containing our HTML code.

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/home", response_class=HTMLResponse)
    async def get_home():
        return """
        <html>
            <head>
                <title> Welcome to Our Online Store </title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <p> Welcome to our online store! Check out our products <a href="/products">here</a>. </p>
            </body>
        </html>
        """

    Overwriting main.py

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

Now, when someone visits the ‚Äú/home‚Äù endpoint of our API, FastAPI will respond with a simple HTML page. The `response_class=HTMLResponse` argument tells FastAPI to convert the returned string into HTML.

Let‚Äôs navigate to the home page.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/langchain/fast-api-html.png)

‚Äúfast-api-html‚Äù

As you can see, our API correctly returns an HTML response for the ‚Äú/home‚Äù endpoint.

In this script, we‚Äôve defined a new /home endpoint that returns an HTML response, effectively serving a simple web page. The response\_class=HTMLResponse argument tells FastAPI to convert the returned string into HTML. We then make a GET request to this endpoint and print the HTML response.

### Path Parameters and Query Parameters

Path parameters and query parameters are two ways to pass dynamic information to an API.

First, let‚Äôs start with **path parameters**. These allow us to pass information via the URL path. We have already used path parameters in our `/cart/{product_id}` endpoints. Let‚Äôs add one more endpoint which gives us the details of a specific product.

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Our product list - a dictionary where key is product id and value is product name
    products = {1: "Sneakers", 2: "T-Shirt", 3: "Jeans", 4: "Sunglasses", 5: "Hat"}
    
    @app.get("/product/{product_id}")
    async def get_product_detail(product_id: int):
        if product_id not in products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"No product found with id {product_id}.")
        return {product_id: products[product_id]}

    Overwriting main.py

Run in **terminal** with command: `uvicorn main:app --reload` and now, a user can get the details of a single product by passing the product id in the URL, such as ‚Äò/product/1‚Äô.

Let‚Äôs try to get the details of a product with id 1 using another terminal `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/1`

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/langchain/bash-fast-params.png)

‚Äúbash-fast-params‚Äù

Great, it works!

Now, let‚Äôs move on to **query parameters**. These offer another way to pass dynamic information to an API, but via the URL query string _(the part of the URL after the ‚Äò?‚Äô)_.

Let‚Äôs say we want to allow users to filter the products by part of their names. We can do that by introducing a query parameter:

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from typing import Optional
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Our product list - a dictionary where key is product id and value is product name
    products = {1: "Sneakers", 2: "T-Shirt", 3: "Jeans", 4: "Sunglasses", 5: "Hat"}
    
    @app.get("/search")
    async def search_products(q: Optional[str] = None):
        if q:
            return {product_id: name for product_id, name in products.items() if q.lower() in name.lower()}
        else:
            return products

    Overwriting main.py

Run in **terminal** with command: `uvicorn main:app --reload` and now, users can search for products by including a ‚Äòq‚Äô parameter in the URL, like ‚Äò/search?q=Sneakers‚Äô.

Let‚Äôs try to search product with q ‚ÄúJeans‚Äù using another terminal `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?q=Jeans`

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/langchain/bash-fast-query.png)

‚Äúbash-fast-query‚Äù

As you can see, our API correctly returned the product that matches our search query.

In this code, we‚Äôve made the following enhancements to our API: - Accepted dynamic path and query parameters. - Added a `/product/{product_id}` endpoint that: - Returns the details of a specific product based on the product id passed in the URL. - Added a `/search` endpoint that: - Allows users to filter the products based on a search query. - The search query is passed as a query parameter in the URL.

We then performed tests on these enhancements: - Made `GET` requests to these endpoints. - Printed the responses for verification.

Project Example: Text Generation API Using Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you‚Äôve crafted an amazing GPT-2 model that can generate witty text, mimicking the style of famous authors. You‚Äôre quite thrilled with this digital author and now you want to share your AI-powered wordsmith with the world. How can you make this happen? You guessed it - let‚Äôs build an API with FastAPI!

Before we embark on this journey, we need to ensure that we have all the necessary tools. We will install two indispensable libraries, Transformers and Torch, using pip:

    %pip install transformers torch

### Setting Up the Text Generation Model

Now, let‚Äôs prepare our AI author by setting up a pipeline for text generation with the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers library:

    from transformers import pipeline
    
    generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

With our generator in place, we‚Äôre ready to start creating masterpieces!

### Building the Text Generation API

Now, we‚Äôre going to design an API that allows users to feed a string of text to our AI author, who will then generate a piece of text based on the input:

    %%writefile main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from transformers import pipeline
    
    generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
    
    class Item(BaseModel):
        text: str
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.post("/api/generate")
    def generate_text(item: Item):
        # Generate text
        outputs = generator(item.text, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=5, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)
        generated_text = [output['generated_text'] for output in outputs]
    
        return {"message": "Text generated!", "generated_text": generated_text}

    Overwriting main.py

Running localhost and ngrok:

    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import uvicorn
    
    # Setup ngrok
    ngrok.set_auth_token(your_ngrok_token)
    
    public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8000", proto="http", bind_tls=True)
    print(f"Public URL: {public_url}")
    
    # Start server
    uvicorn.run(app='main:app', host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, use_colors=True)

And there you have it! We‚Äôve just created an endpoint ‚Äò/api/generate‚Äô that accepts POST requests. This endpoint expects a string of text as input in the form of JSON data. It takes this text, feeds it to our AI author, and in response, provides five unique continuations of the initial text.

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs), [https://{ngrok-url}/docs](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/docs) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) or [https://{ngrok-url}/redoc](https://%7Bngrok-url%7D/redoc) for interactive documentation your API

With FastAPI and Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers, you‚Äôve just turned your local GPT-2 model into a globally accessible AI-powered author. This is the beauty of APIs in machine learning. This project is a foundation upon which you can build more complex APIs, integrating different models and tasks to suit your needs.

Wrapping Up
-----------

FastAPI provides an intuitive and flexible way to build robust APIs, and you‚Äôve just scratched the surface by designing an API for text generation with a GPT-2 model. We walked through setting up endpoints, handling JSON data, routing, error handling, and making our API globally accessible with ngrok. We also took a deep dive into the dynamic world of path and query parameters.

Equipped with these tools, you‚Äôre now set to construct comprehensive, powerful, and secure APIs. Keep practicing, keep exploring, and before you know it, you‚Äôll be an accomplished FastAPI maestro!
