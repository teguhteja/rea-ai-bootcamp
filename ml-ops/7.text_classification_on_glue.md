Fine-tuning a model on a text classification task
=================================================

In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) model to a text classification task of the [GLUE Benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/).

Widget inference on a text classification task

The GLUE Benchmark is a group of nine classification tasks on sentences or pairs of sentences which are:

*   [CoLA](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/) (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability) Determine if a sentence is grammatically correct or not.is a dataset containing sentences labeled grammatically correct or not.
*   [MNLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426) (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference) Determine if a sentence entails, contradicts or is unrelated to a given hypothesis. (This dataset has two versions, one with the validation and test set coming from the same distribution, another called mismatched where the validation and test use out-of-domain data.)
*   [MRPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398) (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus) Determine if two sentences are paraphrases from one another or not.
*   [QNLI](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Question-answering Natural Language Inference) Determine if the answer to a question is in the second sentence or not. (This dataset is built from the SQuAD dataset.)
*   [QQP](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) (Quora Question Pairs2) Determine if two questions are semantically equivalent or not.
*   [RTE](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Recognizing_Textual_Entailment) (Recognizing Textual Entailment) Determine if a sentence entails a given hypothesis or not.
*   [SST-2](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) Determine if the sentence has a positive or negative sentiment.
*   [STS-B](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark) Determine the similarity of two sentences with a score from 1 to 5.
*   [WNLI](https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html) (Winograd Natural Language Inference) Determine if a sentence with an anonymous pronoun and a sentence with this pronoun replaced are entailed or not. (This dataset is built from the Winograd Schema Challenge dataset.)

We will see how to easily load the dataset for each one of those tasks and use the `Trainer` API to fine-tune a model on it. Each task is named by its acronym, with `mnli-mm` standing for the mismatched version of MNLI (so same training set as `mnli` but different validation and test sets):

    GLUE_TASKS = ["cola", "mnli", "mnli-mm", "mrpc", "qnli", "qqp", "rte", "sst2", "stsb", "wnli"]

This notebook is built to run on any of the tasks in the list above, with any model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) as long as that model has a version with a classification head. Depending on you model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those three parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly:

    task = "wnli"
    model_checkpoint = "w11wo/indo-roberta-small"
    batch_size = 64

Loading the dataset
-------------------

We will use the [ü§ó Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to download the data and get the metric we need to use for evaluation (to compare our model to the benchmark). This can be easily done with the functions `load_dataset` and `load_metric`.

    from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric

Apart from `mnli-mm` being a special code, we can directly pass our task name to those functions. `load_dataset` will cache the dataset to avoid downloading it again the next time you run this cell.

    # actual_task = "mnli" if task == "mnli-mm" else task
    # dataset = load_dataset("glue", actual_task)
    
    
    dataset = load_dataset("indonlu", "smsa")
    metric = load_metric('glue', "mnli")

Preprocessing the data
----------------------

    from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, use_fast=True)

    def tokenize_function(example):
        return tokenizer(example["text"], truncation=True)
    
    encoded_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

{"version\_major":2,"version\_minor":0,"model\_id":"a5c108a34c2b4a28ab4de49c56eefa13","quarto\_mimetype":"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json"}

Fine-tuning the model
---------------------

    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer
    
    num_labels = 3
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, num_labels=num_labels)

    Some weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at w11wo/indo-roberta-small and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
    You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

    metric_name = "pearson" if task == "stsb" else "matthews_correlation" if task == "cola" else "accuracy"
    model_name = model_checkpoint.split("/")[-1]
    
    args = TrainingArguments(
        f"{model_name}-finetuned-indonlu-smsa",
        evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
        save_strategy = "epoch",
        overwrite_output_dir = True,
        learning_rate=2e-5,
        per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
        num_train_epochs=10,
        weight_decay=0.005,
        warmup_steps = 1000,
        load_best_model_at_end=True,
        metric_for_best_model=metric_name,
        push_to_hub=True,
        report_to = 'wandb',
        run_name = 'roberta-mini-run-2'
    )

Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for training, as well as the weight decay. Since the best model might not be the one at the end of training, we ask the `Trainer` to load the best model it saved (according to `metric_name`) at the end of training.

The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn‚Äôt follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/bert-finetuned-mrpc"` or `"huggingface/bert-finetuned-mrpc"`).

The last thing to define for our `Trainer` is how to compute the metrics from the predictions. We need to define a function for this, which will just use the `metric` we loaded earlier, the only preprocessing we have to do is to take the argmax of our predicted logits (our just squeeze the last axis in the case of STS-B):

    def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
        predictions, labels = eval_pred
        if task != "stsb":
            predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
        else:
            predictions = predictions[:, 0]
        return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)

Then we just need to pass all of this along with our datasets to the `Trainer`:

    validation_key = "validation_mismatched" if task == "mnli-mm" else "validation_matched" if task == "mnli" else "validation"
    trainer = Trainer(
        model,
        args,
        train_dataset=encoded_dataset["train"],
        eval_dataset=encoded_dataset[validation_key],
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        compute_metrics=compute_metrics
    )

You might wonder why we pass along the `tokenizer` when we already preprocessed our data. This is because we will use it once last time to make all the samples we gather the same length by applying padding, which requires knowing the model‚Äôs preferences regarding padding (to the left or right? with which token?). The `tokenizer` has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the `Trainer` will use it. You can customize this part by defining and passing your own `data_collator` which will receive the samples like the dictionaries seen above and will need to return a dictionary of tensors.

We can now finetune our model by just calling the `train` method:

     import numpy as np
    trainer.train()
