    "# Working with Files\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions to handle file manipulation from creating, reading to writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Text Files\n",
    "To read a text file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function with the desired file path and mode. The most common modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **'r'**: read (default mode)\n",
    "- **'w'**: write\n",
    "- **'a'**: append\n",
    "- **'x'**: create (and write)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs an example of reading a text file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Text Files\n",
    "To write data to a text file, you can use the `open()` function with the **'w'** (write) or **'a'** (append) mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we write data to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = \"This is a text file.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Suppose you have a CSV file with user data that needs to be cleaned and transformed before being saved into a new file. The CSV file has the following columns: **user_id, name, email, and age**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample CSV Data\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "user_id,name,email,age\n",
    "1,John Doe,johndoe@example.com,32\n",
    "2,Jane Smith,janesmith@example.com,28\n",
    "3,James Brown,jamesbrown@example.com,55\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python script reads the CSV file, removes all users aged below 30, and saves the new data into another file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "input_file = 'users.csv'\n",
    "output_file = 'filtered_users.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(input_file, 'r') as infile, open(output_file, 'w', newline='') as outfile:\n",
    "    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(infile)\n",
    "    fieldnames = csv_reader.fieldnames\n",
    "\n",
    "    csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n",
    "    csv_writer.writeheader()\n",
    "\n",
    "    for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "        if int(row['age']) >= 30:\n",
    "            csv_writer.writerow(row)\n",
