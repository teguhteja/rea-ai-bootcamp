    "# Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a popular open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It provides flexible and efficient data structures that make it easier to handle and analyze data. Pandas is particularly well-suited for structured or tabular data, such as CSV and Excel files, SQL databases, or dataframes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Pandas for Data Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Handling\n",
    "Pandas can handle a variety of data sets in different formats—CSV files, Excel files, or database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ease of Use\n",
    "With only a few lines of code, Pandas makes it easy for users to read, write, and modify datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation\n",
    "It offers robust tools for cleaning and pivoting data, preparing it for analysis or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Operations\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of NumPy, a Python library for numerical computation, which makes it efficient for performing operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration\n",
    "It integrates well with many other libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, such as Matplotlib for plotting graphs, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can be installed in your Python environment using package managers like `pip` or `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Pandas Using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re using a Jupyter notebook, you can install it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation on your system, you can use pip in your command line:\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Pandas Using conda\n",
    "If you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can use the conda package manager to install Pandas. Type the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "conda install pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can import and check the installed Pandas version in your Python script as follows:\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pd.__version__)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5.3\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print the version of Pandas installed in your environment to ensure it’s correctly installed.\n",
    "Pandas Data Structures\n",
    "Pandas Series\n",
    "What is a Series?\n",
    "A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a vector in a mathematical matrix.\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be created from dictionaries, ndarrays, and scalar values.\n",
    "Each item in a Series object has an index, which is a label that uniquely identifies it.\n",
    "Series are similar to ndarrays and can be passed into most NumPy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in a relational database, an Excel spreadsheet, or a dictionary of Series objects.\n",
    "Basic Example of a DataFrame\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n",
    "    'Age': [25, 30, 35],\n",
    "    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Name  Age         City\n",
    "0    Alice   25     New York\n",
    "1      Bob   30  Los Angeles\n",
    "2  Charlie   35      Chicago\n"
